# ModelName: Corresponding to the model file in the model directory,
# - such as YourModelName.pb, fill in YourModelName here.
# CharSet: Provides a default optional built-in solution:
# - [ALPHANUMERIC, ALPHANUMERIC_LOWER, ALPHANUMERIC_UPPER,
# -- NUMERIC, ALPHABET_LOWER, ALPHABET_UPPER, ALPHABET, ALPHANUMERIC_LOWER_MIX_CHINESE_3500]
# - Or you can use your own customized character set like: ['a', '1', '2'].
# CharMaxLength: Maximum length of charactersï¼Œ used for label padding.
# CharExclude: CharExclude should be a list, like: ['a', '1', '2']
# - which is convenient for users to freely combine character sets.
# - If you don't want to manually define the character set manually,
# - you can choose a built-in character set
# - and set the characters to be excluded by CharExclude parameter.

# TrainsPath and TestPath: The local absolute path of your training and testing set.
# DatasetPath: Package a sample of the TFRecords format from this path.
# TrainRegex and TestRegex: Default matching apple_20181010121212.jpg file.
# - The Default is .*?(?=_.*\.)
# TestSetNum: This is an optional parameter that is used when you want to extract some of the test set
# - from the training set when you are not preparing the test set separately.
# SavedSteps: A Session.run() execution is called a Step,
# - Used to save training progress, Default value is 100.
# ValidationSteps: Used to calculate accuracy, Default value is 500.
# TestSetNum: The number of test sets, if an automatic allocation strategy is used (TestPath not set).
# EndAcc: Finish the training when the accuracy reaches [EndAcc*100]% and other conditions.
# EndCost: Finish the training when the cost reaches EndCost and other conditions.
# EndEpochs: Finish the training when the epoch is greater than the defined epoch and other conditions.
# BatchSize: Number of samples selected for one training step.
# TestBatchSize: Number of samples selected for one validation step.
# LearningRate: Recommended value[0.01: MomentumOptimizer/AdamOptimizer, 0.001: AdaBoundOptimizer]
